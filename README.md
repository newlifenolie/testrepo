# testrepo

This is for practice purpose
You would typically use Git commands from your own desktop/laptop. However, so you can get started using the commands quickly without having to download or install anything, we are providing an IDE with a Terminal on the Cloud. Simply click the Open Tool button below to launch the Skills Network Cloud IDE and in the new browser tab that launches, follow the instructions to practice the Git commands.

After completing this lab you will be able to use git commands to start working with creating and managing your code branches, including:

create a new local repository using git init

create and add a file to the repo using git add

commit changes using git commit

create a branch using git branch

switch to a branch using git checkout

check the status of files changed using git status

review recent commits using git log

revert changes using git revert

get a list of branches and active branch using git branch

merge changes in your active branch into another branch using git merge
